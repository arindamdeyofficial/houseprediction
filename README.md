Kaggle Data: https://www.kaggle.com/dhirajnirne/california-housing-data

1. null value
null value > 95% reject
null value > 95% but imporatant || < 95% =>  replace ith fabricated value
continuous variable the fill with mean / median and if discrete then fill/impute with mode
[1 2 5 8 49 84]
mean = 24.83
median - 13/2 = 6.5
mean first preferrence the median then mode
2. Data variation
Normalisation / scaling
(Data - Mean)/(std. Deviation)
3. Linear Regression
it doesn't support nonnumeric data
convert to numeric
Onehot encoding

4. Scatter Plot
Is there any outlier
3 sigma outlier model

5. train and test data divide
Target variable
other indipendent variable
 
6. OLS Table
From stat model
